Game jams are an interesting event. In it, a bunch of programmers, artists, musicians, designers, and more, all come together to make games. Everyone has a different set of skills and they meet up in a certain area, group up with people they've just met in the venue, and then devote an entire weekend to making a complete game.

It's essentially a work crunch done voluntarily. Described that way, it sounds like a punishment! Yet there are thousands of game jams worldwide with hundreds of participants in different roles, all willing to spend their free time on the event. One may ask: for what are game jams done everywhere? Most game jams don't even have prizes as they're considered to be friendly events!

Even with all that said, I think everyone would benefit from trying out a game jam at least once. There's a reason why game jammers seem to go back again and again to make more games. Here are some reasons why!

## It's Great Practice

One thing to note is that it's extremely good practice for game development. The people who join game jams range from complete novices who stepped in for the first time, to seasoned veterans who've made award-winning games. All of them join becuase they're aware of how useful game jams are in polishing their skills.

Game jams are essentially no-pressure areas where people can try things out. Novices can dip their toes in the water and make a game for the first time, while more experienced participants cantest out things that they've wanted to do in a game. This could be something like a new genre, game mechanic, asset pipeline, or even game engine, can all be done in game jams. And if it doesn't work out? It's okay! The important thing is that you learned from the experience.

## Go Through The Entire Game Developement Process

What's interesting in a game jam is that it's essentially the entire game making process in a capsule. ONce the theme is announced, the team will gather up and brainstorm ideas for a game. Ideas are thrown around, discussed, thrown away, expounded upon until people agree on an interesting idea. People then get started on making a prototype for the game, a quick and rough build that holds the game mechanics and essence.

It doesn't have to look grand or sound great yet. It's just a prototype after all. Once the mechanics are done well, that's when they can start build and polishing.

An important thing about the process is that it's not the Waterfall Approach seen in software development as you constantly iterate to Step 1, Step 2 and so on. Teams can and often will go back to previous steps if people see that something is incomplete. Maybe someone realized the mechanics weren't fun, so the team would go back to the drawing board to fix it. Maybe there was a bug in the gameplay that's easily exploited, so people go back to the rough sketches of the prototype to adjust the numbers and make a more enjoyable experience. Each step is done again and again until people are satisfied and until a game is made.

This is essentially the game making process crammed into 2-3 days. In the proces you go from idea generation,to making a minimum viable product, to polishing the game, to finally releasing it. A game jam team goes through this process at super speed, and so they become aware of the sticking points and barriers of each stage of development. After going through enough game jams, they know which parts to preemptively focus on and fix. If we only learned about those problems while making games with long development times, the lessons learned would appear slowly compared to the quick education that a game jam would provide.

## Learn The Basic Principles In Game Development

To expound on the previous point, game jammers learn a lot of principles in making games early on due to their failures and problems in past game jams. How many game jammers have had lofty dreams for their jam game, only to be crushed by their own scope and end up not finishing? Or how many game jammers thought they could spend the first 90% of their time on the game mechanices, with only the last 10% for polishing? Anyone who did so would realize that polishing a game takes way more time than that. 

What if someone thought their mediocre game mechanic was actually amazing and refused to kill their darling. Instead, they wanted to polish it, thinking it would bring out the greatness of their idea. Hate to break it to you, but you can't polish a turd. The game should've been fun even with placeholder images and souds. If the mechanic can't stand on its own, it's back to the drawing board. Polish increases the fun but it doesn't make it.

## Work With A Team

As mentioned earlier, a game jam invites people in different roles in the game development industry. Programmers meet up with visual artists, musicians, level designers, SFX artists, producers, etc. The whole gamut can be found here, and hence is a great way to network and practice working with a team. Since each jam can have a completely different set of people (except if you brought your own team), you end up working with different personalities and temperaments.

Communication is key for all teams, and in game development especially so. With the goal of creating a game, everyone has to be motivated and heading in the same direction: towards a built game. At the same time, creative differences and misigivings will inevitably happen and must be resolved. Even in a low-pressure environment like a game jam, a low-cohesion team will feel more tension tha a team that cooperates well.

## Stretch Your Creative Muscles

An interesting thing about game jams is that they usually have a theme. This theme, which may be captured or required depending on the jam, is only announced at the start of the jam. That way it's fair as everyone has the same time to think of an idea. Since everybody has the same theme, this is a chance to practice your creativity and make something that stands out.

Miziziziz, an indie game developer and Youtuber, has this idea when thinking of ideas for a game jam: "I think of the first five ideas that come to my head. Once I have those, I throw them away, since I'm sure that somebody else must've thought of it as well. Only then I start thinking of game ideas that I can actually use". This sort of process is interesting and really emphasizes the importance of creativity in a jam!

Of course, you're free to use any idea in the end, even if it's relatively common. In the end, execution makes a huge difference.

## Finish A Game

Since most game jams don't have a prize or rankings, what does someone get from entering it? Aside from the experiences and memories, there's also the joy in having built your own game!  Most people have a problem with finishing games at the start of their creative pursuit. There's a tendency to only focus only the fun part and ignoring the polishing and UI, which leards to a slew of unfinished games in their wake. Finishing is a skill, and one of the ways to train that skill is through game jams. They provide an extrinsic deadline so people wouldn't extend their games indefinitely by adding whatever pops up in their head. When the game jam's time is up, ready or not, you have to submit! It's this slight push from the deadline that helps people learn to finish games.

## It's Fun

Last but not the least, it's fun! Why else would you spend your free time crunching a game with strangers? The thrill of starting from scratch, building with your fellow game enthusiasts, going through the highs and lows of game development! All in 2-3 days! It all ends up with a finished game, several friends made, and an experience that you won't forget. If you took a physical game jam, you can go around and test other people's games, chat and share tips, and have a good time in a community that just enjoys creating games. What more can you ask for?

## Join A Game Jam Now!

All in all, doing a game jam is an experience you'll never forget. I'm sure if you ask a game jammer about his game, they can tell you what happened in each jam that it was made, as well as the game that they made. Creative pursuits like gamedev will definitely create some emotional moments. In an event like a game jam, where hundreds of people make games at the same time, it simply becomes magical.
