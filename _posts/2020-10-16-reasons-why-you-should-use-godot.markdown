I finally did it. I went ahead and installed Unity to try it out.

Also, what made me pull the trigger was the fact that Unity (finally!) had Dark Mode in its free version! It's a small thing that adds a lot of value, so I always wondered why that feature was locked behind a paywall.

## Unity vs Godot

Usually when I hear posts about Unity vs Godot, it's about how a person moved from Unity to Godot since it suited their needs better.

## 1 - It's An Industry Standard

Of course, I believe that this will change soon as Godot slowly keeps improving. As of now however, when someone is making a team for a game, more often than not they will look for a Unity or UE4 game developer.

## 2 - Easy Cross-Platform Release

Godot 4.0 is stated to release some time next year, with a lot of features that I'm looking forward to. Because of that, most of us seem perpetually waiting for Godot.

## Conclusion

Of course, maybe this is just me appreciating the shiny new thing in front of me. Give me a few more months trying this out and see what I'll say next. I'll update you guys right after I make those games I've been dying to create. See you!
