So this is my game, One Arrow Rampage, a fast-paced platformer where you grapple around the area while going on a murder spree! I made it for the Godot Wild Jam, a jam where people take advantage of the Godot game engine and export to multiple platforms.
It's my first time doing a platformer, so I learned a lot about proper player movement in this genre, particularly:

1. air control 

2. ground acceleration, friction, and reactive turning 

3. non-analog jumping 

4. coyote time and jump call tolerance 

5. weighty jumping (avoiding that floating feeling) 
Even if you've read the concept, I realized that fine-tuning them is best done through playtesting! Especially when one of your mechanics is a movement-based as my grapple mechanic is.
