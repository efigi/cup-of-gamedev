I finally did it. I went ahead and installed Unity to try it out.

Also, what made me pull the trigger was the fact that Unity (finally!) had Dark Mode in its free version! It's a small thing that adds a lot of value, so I always wondered why that feature was locked behind a paywall.

## Unity vs Godot

Usually when I hear posts about Unity vs Godot, it's about how a person moved from Unity to Godot since it suited their needs better.

## 1 - It's An Industry Standard

Of course, I believe that this will change soon as Godot slowly keeps improving. As of now however, when someone is making a team for a game, more often than not they will look for a Unity or UE4 game developer.

Looking at all the job postings, you'll have a hard time looking for someone asking for a Godot programmer. It's understandable since Godot is still a relatively new engine, but that still gives Unity an advantage in this regard.

## 2 - Easy Cross-Platform Release

I'm sure some people are going, "Hey! Godot can release to multiple platforms too! PC/Mac/Linux as well as Android/iOS! The consoles are lacking official support but can be fixed with third-party exports!" And I have to agree with that.

However, one thing that is problematic with exports with Godot is its reliance on scons once custom modules are needed. Export templates are easy enough to use as long as you're using the software on its own, but compiling from code and making your own templates adds a boatload of problems.

Each platform requires a lot of dependencies that have to to be detected before scons could work on that platform. The dependence change depending on which platform your computer is, with certain dependencies not even working on a platform like Mac for example.

Unity on the other hand has much more intuitive cross-platform support. It works easily for Mac/PC/Linux, the Android and iOS ecosystems are relatively easy to setup, and console support is easier than in Godot.

## 3 - It Has More Tutorials

I've been a huge subscriber of the Godot tutorials of GDQuest and I've supported him greatly in his tutorials. I've bought several of his courses and supported the product from his Kickstarter. I believe tutorials are an important part of what makes a game engine good, and so people like the GDQuest team members are a godsend.

Sadly, Brackeys said goodbye on his Youtube Channel a while back, but the plethora of videos on Unity is more than enough to get you up to speed.

Brackey's of course isn't the only Youtuber who uploads tutorials on Unity. Tutorials on Unity can be found online almost everywhere! From video sites like Youtube or Vimeo, to education sites like Udemy or Coursera, to even personal websites online! The amount of information you can find online is endless. If there's something you want done: a certain shader look, a way to generate maps, a way to move your character around, there's a high chance someone has made it in Unity and has made a tutorial about it.

## 4 - Bigger Community

The community is also bigger in Unity! While I've found the Godot community to be really helpful and slowly increasing over the years, it still pales in comparison to Unity's community. This is to be expected due to how old Unity is compared to Godot, but it's still something to be said.

The market share of Unity means more people use it, and so you have more people in the community that you can work with and ask for help from when you get stuck on something. Having colleagues that one can ask for help for is a huge boon for solo game developers, and so a community like this would be a great help for someone working on their own game.

## 5 - The Asset Store is superb

I would go ahead and say it: this reason alone should be enough for any solo game developer to make the switch. No man is an island, though a solo gamedev tries to be. I'm sure you've already tried to wear several hats that shoul've been filled by an entire team. You've been doing the programmming,

## 6 - The Unity Distribution Portal

A relatively new release, this would allow you to distribute to several app stores available with the ease of releasing to one. The ease of distribution allows deployment that could reach app stores that some developers might not have thought of. It even has an app store that published in China!

The reach allowed by the UDP cannot be understated for solo game developers, as one doesn't have to worry anymore about the logistics of working with each app store and adding the different SDKs and APIs for each of them, as Unity assists you on this part.

## 7 - We're Waiting for Godot (4.0)

Godot 4.0 is stated to release some time next year, with a lot of features that I'm looking forward to. Because of that, most of us seem perpetually waiting for Godot.

There are constantly loads of updates being added to Godot 4.0, not only in 3D but also in the 2D space. The 2D part of Godot's game engine hasn't been updated in several years, but 4.0 will have several that could be considered real game changers.

## Conclusion

Of course, maybe this is just me appreciating the shiny new thing in front of me. Give me a few more months trying this out and see what I'll say next. I'll update you guys right after I make those games I've been dying to create. See you!
