From their website:

> Each year we give away thousands of dollars worth of sound effects for free in celebration of the Game Developers Conference. This is our archive. Everything is royalty-free and commercially usable. No attribution is required and you can use them on an unlimited number of projects.

> All of the files we send out are just a small sample of our suppliers complete collection. We usually pick a couple of sounds from each library added to Sonniss over the year. None of the files we are giving away have been modified in any way, they are exactly the same files we sell. If you would like more options and design choices to work with, please consider purchasing the corresponding collection.

If you need any help or have any concerns, don't hesitate to contact timothy@sonniss.com.
