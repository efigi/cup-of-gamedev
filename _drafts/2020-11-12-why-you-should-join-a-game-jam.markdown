Game jams are an interesting even.t In it, a bunch of programmers, artists, musicians, designers, and more, all come together to make games. Everyone has a different set of skills and they meet up in a certain area, group up with people they've just met in the venue, and then devote an entire weekend to making a complete game. It's essentially a work crunch done voluntarily. Described that way, it sounds like a punishment! Yet there are thousands of game jams worldwide with hundreds of participants in different roles, all willing to spend their free time on the event. One may ask: for what are game jams done everywhere? Most game jams don't even have prizes as they're considered to be friendly events!

Even with all that saidm I think everyone would benefit from trying out a game jam at least once. There's a reason why game jammers seem to go back again and again to make more games. Here are some reasons why!

## It's Great Practice

One thing to note is that it's extremely good practice for game development. The people who join game jams range from complete novices who stepped in for the first time, to seasoned veterans who've made award-winning games. All of them join becuase they're aware of how useful game jams are in polishing their skills.

Game jams are essentially no-pressure areas where people can try things out. Novices can dip their toes in the water and make a game for the first time, while more experienced participants cantest out things that they've wanted to do in a game. This could be something like a new genre, game mechanic, asset pipeline, or even game engine, can all be done in game jams. And if it doesn't work out? It's okay! The important thing is that you learned from the experience.

## Goes Through The Entire Game Developement Process

What's interesting in a game jam is that it's essentially the entire game making process in a capsule. ONce the theme is announced, the team will gather up and brainstorm ideas for a game. Ideas are thrown around, discussed, thrown away, expounded upon until people agree on an interesting idea. People then get started on making a prototype for the game, a quick and rough build that holds the game mechanics and essence.

It doesn't have to look grand or sound great yet. It's just a prototype after all. Once the mechanics are done well, that's when they can start build and polishing.

An important thing about the process is that
